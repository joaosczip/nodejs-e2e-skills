# nodejs-e2e-skills

`nodejs-e2e-skills` is a repository of reusable `skills` for coding agents.

Its intention is simple: give agents a practical skill set for end-to-end testing in Node.js projects.

These skills are meant to help agents:

- set up and run E2E tests
- write stable, maintainable test flows
- handle common testing concerns (auth, fixtures, test data, CI)
- debug failures and improve reliability over time

In short, this project is a focused knowledge base for Node.js E2E testing workflows that agents can apply consistently.
